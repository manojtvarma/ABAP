**select
	select [single] */fieldnames from dbtable 
	into [table][corresponding fields of] workarea/itab
	[where fieldname = value]

Note:
-->If fields selected and itab fields are not same then we use 
corresponding fields of.

-->If we want only one row as result then we use keyword
single after select.if we dont specify where condition then 1st record is o/p.

-->we can use aggregate function in select stmt but generally we dont use directly on select stmt
we select all the records in itab then we perform operations on itab. 

Eg:
select count(*) from dbtable into no_of_records-->using aggregate function
OR
select * from dbtable into table itab.
describe table itab lines no_of_records.
